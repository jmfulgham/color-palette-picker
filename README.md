# Color Palette Builder - WIP

The color palette builder application was originally a live coding challenge I needed to fix, and I decided to tweak it
and make it more visually appealing.

## Quick Start

### Starting the application

This application is written in React with Vite. To get it up and running yourself

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
